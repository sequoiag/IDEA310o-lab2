In my github the buildings are not included in my file, however I got the rest of my information to commit. For some reason Github thinks the buildings are
too large to commit and push. Nonetheless the rest of my files are now included. The youtube video does say I have a .tif file however I changed that when I 
realized that the .tif stopped my changed in unity from pushing to github also.

I mainly followed the tutorial and did not make much of a change to the game. However I added a useable item, "evil potion", which kills the player when 
used. Then I added an equitable item "AttackSpeed" this reduces the attack cool down by 5. Then I also customized a weapon "CactusDoll" that is used as
a staff when equipped. Overall I had fun with this tutorial. I majorly struggled with figuring out how to customize my game with the way the tutorial had 
the game set up. However I managed and I am proud of my work :)
