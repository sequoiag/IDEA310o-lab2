In my gitignore file I added a *.tif so the building are not in my github because they were too big to merge. However the building are in my build :)

I mainly followed the tutorial and did not make much of a change to the game. However I added a useable item, "evil potion", which kills the player when 
used. Then I added an equiptable item "AttackSpeed" this reduces the attack cool down by 5. Then I also customized a weapon "CactusDoll" that is used as
a staff when equipted. Overall I had fun with this tutorial. I majorly stuggled with figuring out how to customize my game with the way the tutorial had 
the game set up. However I managed and I am proud of my work :)
